- G4DS
- SoapSy 
- PyXML
- SoapXML RPC by Konstantinos Xynos (kxynos@glam.ac.uk) (now coming with this package)
- SoapSy Tools (download from j4-itrl-12.comp.glam.ac.uk/g4ds#download)

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

1) G4DS preparations
- install g4ds first (from now we assume it's working)
- create a private key with g4ds, which we use later on for connecting (authenticating) against it (maintain in g4ds)
    * save the private key at the location stated in your ioids config file
- make this service known to g4ds
    * run g4ds maintain and apply the service description (provided in the sub folder descriptions) to the g4ds system

2) Unpack archive to location of your choice
- change into this directory

3) Database preparations
- SoapXML RPC database connector is now included in the IOIDS package - it is installed automatically, ones you run the setup of ioids (#4)
- Create an SQL script using the provided XDS program
    * run XDS python program and create SQL script this way
        python thirdparty/soap_db/soap_server/XDS.py -i desriptions/IOIDS_SoapSy_DatabaseSchema.xml -o descriptions/IOIDS_SoapSy_DatabaseSchema.sql
- Change os user to postgres
    * su - postgres
- Create user in database mangement system
    * createuser -P uioids
    <type password 'pwioids'>
- Create database for ioids
    * createdb -O uioids ioids
    * exit (leave user postgres)
- Run the provided SQL Script and create relations in database
    * psql -U uioids [-h localhost] ioids -f descriptions/IOIDS_SoapSy_DatabaseSchema.sql 
    
4) Installation
- Distribute the files over the local filesystem (sitepackages, config files and programs) - as root
    * su
    * python setup.py install
    * exit
- check and adjust permissions for rc-script and python script
    * chmod 755 /etc/init.d/xsmrc
    * chmod 755 /usr/bin/XSM.py
- Make the IOIDS access control policies known to the G4DS system
    * copy policy files (descriptions/*.pol) to G4DS policy system folder (default /var/lib/g4ds/policies)
    * register files in g4ds configuration file (default /etc/g4ds.conf - value POLICY_FILES)
    * apply changes to current g4ds policies for activation (see descriptions/ioids_g4ds_policy.pol for details)
    
5) Configuration
- edit the global configuration file (config.py)
    * check everything in there and adjust to your needs
- edit the SoapXML RPC database configuration file
    * check settings in /etc/XSM-configuration.xml
