Introduction
------------
IOIDS is a project of Michael Pilgermann for his PhD. It is about a network of different Intrusion Detection
Systems, which are interconnected in order to exchange incident related information between each other.

IOIDS is making use of facilities from Grid for Digital Security (G4DS) - the other partial project for the
PhD. Practically, G4DS is providing the communication infrastructure, whereby IOIDS is implementing an
application of top of this.
