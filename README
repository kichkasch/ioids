README for Inter-Organisational Intrusion Detection System

The Inter-Organisational Intrusion Detection System (IOIDS) is a peer-based communication plattform (GRID) 
for sharing computer incident related information across organisational boundaries.

This is only a meta file - in this repository you may find the code of all programming efforts for the IOIDS project.
Browse sub directories and see READMEs in there for more information.

First source of information is its home page:
