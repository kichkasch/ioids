Introduction
------------
Grid for Digital Security (G4DS) is a project of the ISRG of the UoG / SoC. This implementation
is a partial approach only, employing the concerns researched by Michael Pilgermann for
his PhD project.

G4DS in this view is a peer-to-peer based knowledge grid communciation plattform. Nodes in
the grid network are called members and they are grouped into so called communities (or better
Trusting Communities).

ToDo

* Permission
    - Create policies for protecting authority actions
    - check action strings whilst parsing policies

* Service Integration
    - finish Test Service
    - add message formats to services
        * either with database (too much hassles)
        * or via KSDL string parsing at initialisation time (not as nice - but very quick therefore) ;)
    - Owners for Fifos
    
* Refactoring
    - split g4dsconfigurationncontroller module
    - split descriptionprocessor module
    - job implementation
    - structure maintainlib
   
* Documents
    - XML Schemas for descriptions
   
* Documentation
