Requirements
------------
* Python Installation (http://www.python.org)
* PostGreSQL Database (http://www.postgresql.org/)
* python site package 'pygresql' for connecting against the database (http://www.pygresql.org/)
* python site package 'PyXML' (http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/)
* python site package 'SSLCrypto' (http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/SSLCrypto/)
    - depending on an openssl installation (source / headers)
* for SOAP protocol implementation
    - site package 'SOAPpy' (http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/)
    - site package 'fpconst' (http://research.warnes.net:9090/~warnes/fpconst/)
* for encryption algorithms
    - site package 'pycrypto' - RSA, ElGamal (http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html)
        There is a conflict between several versions of PyCrypto. Make sure you are running
        the same version on all nodes. Current Version here: pycrypto-2.0-r1
        Furthermore, make sure you install the full PyCrypto version (otherwise, ezPyCrypto will
        fail to load) - some distributions (such as Ubuntu) do not provide all algorithms by default and
        you have to download and install manually.
    - site package 'ezPyCrypto' - RSA, ElGamal (http://www.freenet.org.nz/ezPyCrypto/)
* Gentoo's python module output.py (for colored console output)
    - if you are not running gentoo, copy the file 'output.py' from the sub directory 'g4ds/thridparty' into the main folder 'g4ds'
    
Unpacking
---------
* Unpack the archive to a location of your choice


Before installation
-------------------
* The database has to be prepared (see also help file DB_HOWTO for more details)
    - create a user (default name 'ug4ds' / default password 'pwg4ds')
    - create a database (default name 'g4ds')
    - create the required tables in the database using the provided script 'sql/createtables.sql'
    

Configuration
-------------
* Edit the main configuration file (module) config.py in the program main folder 'g4ds'
    - apply your settings for your organisation at the top of the file (name, organisation, ...) - will be part of your member description
    - apply your settings for the database host and port
    - if you didn't use default user / password / database; apply the settings here
* Edit the configuration file for protocols in 'g4ds/protocols/config.py'
    - check the settings for the protocols, especially the local IP address and ports
* Edit the configuration file for algorithms in 'g4ds/algorithms/config.py'
* Run the install module 'install.py' from the g4ds directory 
    - This prepares your local node for G4DS by distributing the knowledge of the config files to the managers and database

    
Distribution
------------
The following steps have to be performed with root priveleges!
    su -    (password)

* Install G4DS as a python site package
    - run the setup module in the g4ds directory with option install:
      python setup.py install
* Check permissions on the files
    - init script "/etc/init.d/g4dsrc" should be executable for "root"
        chmod u+x /etc/init.d/g4dsrc
    - g4ds listener module "/usr/sbin/g4dslistener.py" should be executable for "root"
        chmod u+x /usr/sbin/g4dslistener.py
* Want to start G4DS backend at bootup time? 
    - For most Linux distributions: Link from your directory of the default boot level to the g4dsrc script:
        ln -s /etc/init.d/g4dsrc /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/99g4dsrc   (assuming, 3 is your default run level)
    - For Gentoo Linux
        rc-update add g4dsrc default
    
Uninstall
---------
* Run the sql script for deleting all the tables 'sql/droptables.sql'
* Delete the g4ds directory with all subdirectories
* Delete the file "/etc/init.d/g4dsrc" (and possible links to it in your runlevel directories)
* Delete the g4ds listener module "g4dslistener.py" from the directory "/usr/sbin"
* Delete the site package g4ds from your local python installation
(sorry for not providing something more handy here yet)
